        Blockchain is a promising technology that has the potential to revolutionize
        Kenya's Electoral Framework. Here are some of its amazing features that make it

            <p>
              Immutability means something that canâ€™t be changed or altered.
              This is one of the top blockchain features that help to ensure
              that the technology will remain as it is, a permanent, unalterable
              network.

          <Feature title="Enhanced Security" icon={<MdGppGood />} align="left">
            <p>
              Enhanced security is one of the most important features of blockchain
              technology. It ensures that all transactions are secure, transparent,
              and tamper-proof, making it an ideal solution for sensitive data
              management.

          <Feature title="Decentralized" icon={<MdShare />} align="right">
            <p>
              Decentralization is a core feature of blockchain technology that
              eliminates the need for a central authority or intermediary. This
              means that no single entity has control over the entire network,
              making it more secure and resistant to attacks or fraud.

            <p>
              A distributed ledger is a database that is shared and synchronized
              across multiple locations or nodes. It allows for secure and transparent
              record-keeping, making it an essential feature of blockchain technology.
              Each participant in the network has access to the same information,
              ensuring trust and accountability.
